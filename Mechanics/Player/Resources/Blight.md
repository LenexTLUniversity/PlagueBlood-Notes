Blight is the main form of currency used when upgrading your skills at a [[Hostnode]].

It can't be found naturally in the world, and is dropped by enemies, with larger and harder enemies dropping more Blight.

Once a player has found enough Blight, they can go to a [[Hostnode]], and into the [[Undervein System]] and unlock new [[Symptoms]] to equip.
