### 🧬 Concept Overview:

**Rotringer** was once the **head bell-ringer of Wyrmheath’s tower**, tasked with keeping time during prayers, funerals, and plague quarantines. When the infection breached the Bellgrave, he stayed behind, tolling the final warning bell until the rope split and his hands bled.

Now, he _is_ the bell.

His body has fused with the **great pendulum**, and his chest cavity contains a **cracked resonance core**, pulsing with plague. Each swing of his body **reverberates soundwaves that infect and disorient**, and his limbs strike like clappers made of rusted bone and brass.
