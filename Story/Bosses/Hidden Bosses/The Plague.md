Location: [[The Plagues Womb]]
# **Concept:** 

Not a monster. Not a god. The Plague is what you were - after you became conscious. A seething, incomprehensible mass of thoughtless mutation, birthed from rot and death.

It speaks to you in your head, and beckons you to join it once again, to become whole, and use the powers you have collected to spread it everywhere - spread the plague to everywhere.

You get a choice:

- You agree, and become part of it again, dooming the world
- You reject, and fight your very nature

If you reject, The Plague seems disappointed, but not angry, like a mother to its child, and simply states that now the time for games is over, and the final fight begins.



# **Visuals:**

A massive, multi-limbed being, vaguely humanoid in silhouette, but formed entirely of writhing flesh, blood soaked growths, and twitching bodies, it using one of those bodies to speak.

With each phase it gets more erratic, more human, as it adapts to you. Until eventually taking  the form of a very uncanny human appearance, almost seeming like a being mimicking what it thinks a human looks like from memory.
