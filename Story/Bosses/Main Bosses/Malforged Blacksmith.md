> _“The fire kept burning long after the work was done.”_

Once the master smith of Wyrmheath Ironpress, he was chosen for a terrible honor: to be fused with plague-bound iron, forging weapons for a war against infection. But the grafting was incomplete. The Blight filled in the gaps.

Now, driven mad by molten pain and echoing chants of labor eternal, he toils beneath the dead factory — hammering the broken into worse shapes, shaping fire not into tools… but into torment.
