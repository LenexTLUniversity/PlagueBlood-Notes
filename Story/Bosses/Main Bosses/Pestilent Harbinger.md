Location: [[Rotting Slums]]


# **Concept:**

"A prophet of pestilence, self-anointed by the Blight. It does not decay as death - but as divinity."

Once wandering preacher, the Pestilent Harbinger embraced the plague as a sacred force - calling it the true will of the divine. As the infection took hold, he willingly let it consume him, his sermons growing more deranged until even the Blight seemed to respond. Now, he roams the Rotting Slums like a holy figure, spewing disease and demanding devotion.
