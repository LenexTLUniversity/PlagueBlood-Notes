# **Concept:**

"It was once a man of cloth - now reduced to nothing but instinct and bile. Left too long to fester in sacred halls, it became the sermon."

The Beast of Rot is a grotesque result of a high priest who succumbed to the plague deep within the catacombs of Saint Beric's Close. His belief that divine suffering would cleanse himself instead accelerated his mutation. Over time, the rot consumed him, growing into a semi-aware mass of tendons, prayers, and boiling tumors - still echoing distorted sermons through broken vocal cords.



# Visuals:

- The creature resembles a pulsing, bloated mount of flesh, malformed with proportions far too large for its frame
- Robes of priests hang in tattered shreds around its frame, rotting into the body
- Its head is fused with a plague bell, split open to reveal a gaping maw that howls distorted chants
- Pustules swell and burst as it moves. A cluster of smaller limbs claw out its chest and sides, glassing hands into a praying motion
- Emits a sickly golden hued light from runes carved into its flesh - mocking divine symbols
