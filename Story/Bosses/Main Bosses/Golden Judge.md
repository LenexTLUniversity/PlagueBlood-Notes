Location: [[Golden Courthouse]]


# **Concept:**

"Justice rotted from the inside out. Where gold once adorned wisdom, it now masks cruelty."

The Golden Judge was once the head of Wyrmheath's highest court, a revered arbiter clad in gold-trimmed robes and driven by zealotry. When the plague spread, he sealed himself and others inside the courthouse, claiming divine authority to pass "final judgement". The Infection warped his mind and body, binding him into a walking gallows, a parody of justice who now enacts wicked trials.



# Visuals:

- Extremely tall, gaunt, and rigid. A golden gilded mask with cracked scales hides his disfigured face
- His arms have fused with pieces of courtroom furniture - one limb is a golden gavel fused into bone, the other a long ceremonial blade made of rusted brass
- He is fused into his chair, only able to his head and arms
- His robe appears regal but torn, flowing like molten gold when he moves
- Chains embedded in his body rattle constantly; some switch unnaturally

## Arena:

- Inside the Golden Courthouse's ruined grand chamber. The floor is cracked marble and gold, with two raised platforms and a large center podium, where the Golden Judge sits
- To the left and right of the Judge, on the smaller raised platforms, sit 4 individuals, two per side, wearing long dark robes and wearing golden masks with hollow eyes
- Chains dangle from the ceiling, reacting to the Judge's attacks
- In the chair behind the judge is a golden statue of a woman, holding a scale and wearing blinds, a smile scratched onto her stoic face
