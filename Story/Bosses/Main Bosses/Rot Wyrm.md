Location: [[The Pit]]


# **Concept:**

"Born from bile, bone, and centuries of waste, it slithers beneath the city, absorbing corpses to grow - a living artery of decay and death."

The Rot Wyrm is a gigantic creature - perhaps once an animal, now a monstrous byproduct of the city's discarded bodies. It thrive in the claustrophobic lower tunnels of The Pit, endlessly burrowing through flesh and soil alike, searing for more bodies to add to itself.



# Visuals:

- Enormous snake-like creature
- Body made up of rotting bodies of people, deformed and stretched to fit its frame
- Dark Green glowing eyes, with bile running out of them
- Parts of it are wrapped in decayed scaffolding or rusted iron bands from old constructions, fused into its skin
