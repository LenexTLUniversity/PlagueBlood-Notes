# üìçLocation: 

- First Encounter: Found deep in the [[Alchemical Sanctum]] in The Archives.
- He can be found behind a partially collapsed chamber only accessible when the player has [[Leech Grip]] ability


# üß™ Appearance / Visuals

## Human Form:
- **Crow Mask:** Classic plague doctor mask, but aged and torn at some spots

- **Outfit:** A heavy alchemical robe, stitched from layers of waxed leather and blackened linen. Burn marks and rusted pins cover it. Sleeves bulge slightly.

- **Movement:** He limps slightly and moves slowly, with occasional bursts of short lived energy

- **Behavior:** Always sits at his desk, writing in a notebook or of sorts.

- **Voice:** Muffled behind the mask, and raspy voice

## Boss Form: 

- **Form:** Vaguely humanoid but hunched over and asymmetrical, now standing taller due to extended limbs and a grotesquely expanded spine that looks like its about to burst out of his back. One arm is extremely bloated and filled with cancerous growths.

- **Mask:** The crow mask has fused into his face - cracked and ripped apart in some sections, revealing blisters on skin

- **Movement:** Jerky, sudden, erratic. He hovers slightly with spurts of energy, bile erupting from his back.
- **Voice:** No longer filtered and muffled. Still raspy-ish, but now deeper and more wet.

- **2nd Phase:** In the 2nd phase, his back rips open, with his spine arching out of his body, half in, half out, another segment having grown from the original spine now serving as a sort of stinger or whip.

# üó®Ô∏è Dialogue 
- Speaks in rhymes
- Has gone clearly mad
- Simply calls himself the Alchemist
- Might say things like:
	- "Did it find you too? The adaptation. The will behind the sickness?"
	- "This wasn't failure... just... a small setback!"
	- "One strand. Two Strands. Three Stands. So many, yet no time!"



# üìú Scattered Journals: 
- Found in different areas and sections of the map, some quite far, implying he's been around the city
- Reading all paints the full descent: from ambitious scientist, to manipulator, to self-experimenting madman. 
- Final journal can be found at his table (the one he is constantly sitting at and writing), and can be read once he is gone (basically when the player can face him in the boss fight)



# üíÄ **Boss Fight (Optional)**:
- Unlocks when the player retrieves all 3 test tubes and leaves the research room, and then returns (at any point)
- Found in a previously locked section of the Alchemical Sanctum inside the research room, using the samples you collected to conduct another experiment
- Experiment goes horribly wrong and he mutates, his body insanely deformed
- Still lucid, but clearly gone fully mad and telling the player to "join her" as they fight



# Storyline:

After the player makes their way past the obstacles, they stumble upon multiple areas with trinkets and tubes, a laboratory. There, the player finds The Alchemist sitting in a chair at a desk, writing in a notebook.

Interacting with him, he looks up at the player, acting surprised at seeing another normal living human being:

"Well, what do we have here? Another still sane? Curious. I had begun to think the city had finished its work!"

"You wonder what I'm doing here? Oh, just a few little experiments here and there, the usual."

"Wait, you came from the outside, did you not? Good, good, good! In that case will you do this old man a favor? I've conducted various experiments around the city, and put some things into little vials. Would you find and bring those to me?"

"You should start by looking in The Drains. If you bring me my vial, I'll make sure to reward you handsomely! Now off you go, I have important work to do!"
