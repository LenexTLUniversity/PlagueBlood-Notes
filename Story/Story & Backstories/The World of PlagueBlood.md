# üåç Setting Overview

PlagueBlood takes place in an alternative version of England, 1765, during a distorted and accelerated Black Death, worsened by secret human experimentation and divine manipulation.

The city of Wyrmheath, once a minor trade hub, is now a festering tomb after the plague reached it and completely overran it - walled off from the outside world and forgotten by all but its cursed inhabitants.

While castles crumble and streets run with infected bile, life persists. Grotesque technologies - not of the future, but twisted interpretations of medieval alchemy and anatomy - power crude surgical tools, organic weaponry, and plague-altering treatments.


# üß¨ The Origin of the Plague

Contrary to common belief within Wyrmheath and other parts of England, the Plague outbreak did not begin in Wyrmheath itself. Its origin lies in London, the hear of England's power and corruption. Deep beneath the catacombs of the capital, the Alchemist first discovered the primordial strain - a parasitic, adaptable pathogen sealed beneath collapsed ruins of pre-Christian age.

The Church, desperate to reclaim authority in a time where technological advances were slowly rotting out believe, permitted the Alchemist to experiment on the strain. They eventually reached a blockage in their progress, researching and testing only being able to achieve so much - they needed test subjects to continue experimentation.

So, under the guise of divine cleansing, they allowed controlled outbreaks in distant regions of England - Wyrmheath among them.

However, allowing it to infect so many people, the pathogen began to mutate, far faster then anticipated, adapting and learning as it infected more people, eventually becoming a semi-sentient lifeform. 

As it became more sentient, it began forming what the Alchemist calls "the Tree" - a network of hive-mind infection stretching across infected lands.

The root of this "tree" was in London, however, news came that a "branch" was forming in Wyrmheath. So, with the roots not that advanced yet, and the Alchemist's obsession with the plague at its peak, he decided to travel to Wyrmheath to study the branch.

For a while, everything seemed to be fine, when suddenly the branch began to aggressively push outwards, spreading the infection to animals such as rats, which quickly began to spread the plague to the people in the slums, and eventually the entire city.

The Church, aware of this, took a desperate measure and sealed off Wyrmheath, with the Alchemist inside - putting it in total lockdown.




# üå≥ The Tree of the Plague

The plague is not a singular being, but a sprawling, adaptive organism. It spreads like a tree:

- **Roots** - buried deep in London, unseen and ancient, and slowly growing as its influence spreads

- **Trunk** - the central mind, buried beneath Westminster Abbey, manipulating and commanding branches

- **Branches** - regional manifestations, each with unique behaviors and their own creations, but all following commands from the root

> The Plague Mother in Wyrmheath is one such branch. She controls the infected within the cities boundaries, and has the goal of spreading out from the city.



# üîí Lockdown in Wyrmheath

When the Wyrmheath branch spiraled out of control, showing signs of independent consciousness, London's authorities panicked. Rather then risk the plague from spreading, they sealed the entire city: 

- No Entry. No Exit. No survivors expected.
- Church forces deployed cleansing squads and bio-purge units before falling silent,
- Letters from survivors are ceased.
- Maps were erased.
- Wyrmheath was declared as a lost cause to the public.



# üó∫Ô∏è Sequel Hook: The Fall of London and A Strange Survivor

Unknown to the London authorities, a piece of the Wyrmheath branch split off, and became its own separate entity, which is the Player. 

After the Player kills the branch, they escape the city and make their way to London, as the Player sensed the root in London, and wanting to eradicate it as well. 

As the Player arrives in London, it is not in great shape. Many people are sick, and the city is slowly falling into ruins due to the effects of the root, with authorities claiming everything is in order, when in reality they are fighting a losing battle.


# Adaptation to the Situation

As the war between the Church, the Crown, and the Plague escalated behind closed gates, humanity turned to desperate measures. In secret laboratories and sanctified slaughterhouses, a new weapon was forged: the **PlagueBloods** ‚Äî humans surgically altered to interface with the very infection they were meant to destroy.

Each PlagueBlood was fitted with a **spinal implant system**, a grotesque lattice of bone, metal, and nerve-rooted sockets designed to accept **Blight Chips** ‚Äî shards of processed plague matter that temporarily grant unnatural abilities: speed, strength, aggression, or control over the infection itself.

The process was **agonizing and lethal**. Of every hundred chosen, perhaps one lived through the initial operation. Even fewer survived the insertion of Blight Chips, and fewer still retained their minds. Those who endured became **inhuman weapons**, walking crucibles of disease and design.

The Player inhabits the **corpse of one such PlagueBlood**, once sent to Wyrmheath as part of a last-ditch "cleansing" force. But the mission failed. The body was killed ‚Äî consumed by the infected ‚Äî and discarded into **The Pit**. There, something found it and took control of it - the Player.
