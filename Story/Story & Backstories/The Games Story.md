# Summary:

The game takes place in Europe, 1348, England.

You, the [[Player]], are in the city of [[Wyrmheath]], which has been put under lockdown to ensure that a strand of the Black Death plague does not escape into the outside world.

The plague in the city is a bit different, as people do still develop rashes and blisters, but slowly go insane, and eventually mutated into abominations that attack anything moving, with there being different [[Mutation Stages]].

You start the game waking up on a pile of corpses, and only later on find out that you are actually the infection itself, as in a part having become sentient, which is why you are able to absorb their [[Blight]] to grow stronger.

You begin to wander through the world, encountering different [[All NPCs]], locations, normal enemies, and [[Bosses]] with different goals, and discover the reason for the plague and why it was created.
