The last holdout of the living. Narrow stone alleys lead to courtyards strung with makeshift barricades and burning braziers.

Here, the faithful and fearful alike cling to dwindling hope. Waiting for their god to rescue them, praying day and night, but so far, no-one responded.

The western gate is sealed - beyond it, screams echo from the infected half. Priests speak in whispers, tending the sick. Guards mutter of growing unrest.

It's not just the plague that festers here, but fear itself, as anyone who tries to enter at this point now, is cut apart by the guards immediately.
