Beneath the city itself lies a hive of brickwork crawlspaces and collapsed plague tunnels. Rats once ruled here - now something larger has taken root.

The ground pulses as you crawl through nesting chambers woven from hair, cloth, skin, and bones. Light doesn't reach these depths.

But further down, you can hear it when you press your ear against the dirty. A very faint heartbeat.
