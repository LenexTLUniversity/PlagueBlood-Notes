A foggy dockside once bustling with shipwrights, ferrymen, and salt-crusted fishermen. Now the tide laps at derelict piers and broken hull that groan like dying beasts.

The scent of brine mixes with rot. Empty  boats drift without oars, bumping gently against the quay. Winches creak in the wind, ropes sway like nooses.

Here, the infection came by water - sailors turned first. Some say you can still hear them rowing, long after the fog swallowed them.
