Once the heart of Wyrmheath, now a rotting bazaar half-swallowed by canvas awnings and the bloated corpses of traders who died mid-haggle.

Despite the stench and decay, desperate survivors still barter here, due to not enough space in Saint Beric's Close for all people, tucked between collapsed stalls and merchant carts.

The infection simmers beneath, drawn to noise and movement. You hear muffled coughing behind boarded storefronts - not all the vendors are dead.
