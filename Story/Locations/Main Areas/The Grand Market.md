Once the heart of Wyrmheath, now a rotting bazaar half-swallowed by canvas awnings and the bloated corpses of traders who died mid-haggle.

Despite the stench and decay, desperate survivors still barter here, due to not enough space in Saint Beric's Close for all people, tucked between collapsed stalls and merchant carts.

The infection simmers beneath, drawn to noise and movement. You hear muffled coughing behind boarded storefronts - not all the vendors are dead.


The Grand Market itself is split into two main areas, the Upper and Lower area.

The Upper area is abandoned, empty streets with many vendor stands standing in desolation, gathering dust, with a few bodies littering the streets.

The Lower area is where most of the people living in this section sought refuge to, deciding to go underground to try and continue normal life, with some vendors adding more and weird items to their catalogue to make any form of money.
