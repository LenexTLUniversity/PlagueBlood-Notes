Filthy and sun-starved, the outer ring of Wyrmheath lies abandoned - its hovels now overgrown with strange fungal blooms and flesh-colored moss. 

Crude signs written in dirt and blood warn you to turn back. 

Children's toys lie where they were dropped. Doors hang open, but nothing human lives inside anymore.

The poor died first, and those that managed to survive somehow, beg for death.
