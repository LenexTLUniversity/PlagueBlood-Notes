Beneath the cobble lies the Drains: a labyrinth of sewers, runoff tunnels, and forgotten maintenance shafts.

The air hangs thick with rot and disease. Choked with bodies and filth, it is said the infection grows best here, pooling sentient masses, and anyone who ventures down here, does not return.

People say echoes don't travel far here. Shadows don't match their sources, and some even say the Drains breathe.
