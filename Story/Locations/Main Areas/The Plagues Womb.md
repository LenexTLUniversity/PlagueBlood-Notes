Deep beneath Wyrmheath - past bone-choked drains and collapsed tombs - lies the Plagues Womb.

It is no chamber, but a living mass of tissues, veins, and memory, pulsing with warm rot.

Here, the city's infection was not spread... it was born.

The air is damp and moist, with tendrils snaking through broken stone like roots. Structures collapse into flesh. Distant, muffled heartbeats shake the walls. 

There are no people here. Only echoes of stone moving. 

Yet, you feel something, a sense of nostalgia, a gentle warmth.

This is where you came from, and your mother waits for you.
