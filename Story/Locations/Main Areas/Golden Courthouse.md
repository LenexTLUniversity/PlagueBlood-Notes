Once the pride of Wyrmheath's justice, now a hollow monument to authority's failure. Gilded statues lie toppled in the rot choked plaza.

Inside, judicial benches are overturned, gallows hang empty, and judges' robes rot where they fell.

However, infected that get too close gather here unnaturally - almost reverently. Someone is still holding trials. But not for the living.
