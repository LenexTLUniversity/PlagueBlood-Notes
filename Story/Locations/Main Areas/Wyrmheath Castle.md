The black crown of the city - looming, imposing, and sealed to most. 

Nobles once feasted here while the city starved. Now, only silence remains.

Ornate halls lie shattered, and grand paintings weep black liquids. 

Yet, through it all, the King still stands, or does he? As those who have seen him tell stories of his change, how he has gone mad, and his behavior being too different. 

It is clear something strong lies here, something ancient, and not just an infection - but a mind. A will. The infection doesn't simply grow here. It rules.
