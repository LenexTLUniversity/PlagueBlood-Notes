- [[Alchemical Sanctum]]

A crumbling tower, inside stacks of parchment and books, all old and some forgotten knowledge. 

Scrolls molder. Tomes bleed ink. Candlelight flickers behind locked doors, yet no one answers when you knock.

Voices whisper facts that were never true.

The infection here warps memory, with fungal growths on stacks of paper releasing toxic fumes. Even the walls seem to change when you turn your back.
