A collapsed district swallowed by a sinkhole, now a jagged abyss that serves as a dumping ground for the deceased and infected people.

This is where your journey begins, on a large pile of corpses, some fresh with blood still flowing, and others rotten, revealing dusty bones. 

To go down here normally, you can descend by broken scaffolding and pulleys once used to go down here for maintenance. 

But further below, in the deepest parts, something stirs in the darkness - bloated and worshipped by the mad. Flesh doesn't rot down there. It changes.
